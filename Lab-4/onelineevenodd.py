#write a well commented code that checks number is even or odd
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Take input from the user and convert it to an integer
# Use a single line conditional expression to check if the number is even or odd
if number % 2 == 0: print(f"{number} is Even")  # If the number is divisible by 2, it is even
else: print(f"{number} is Odd")  # If the number is not divisible by
